### Description:
This is a final project video game created for Cpts122, a basic shooter where you occupy the bottom screen while enemies occupy the top screen. You goal is to kill the enemies by throwing projectile stars at them, hitting an enemy 3 times will kill them. Vice versa, they throw projectiles back at you, so you must maneuver and dodge their stars with your ability to dash.

### Set-up:
*This code is made with Visual Studios 2015 using SFML. To make the game work, make sure the program directories include the "include" and "lib" files of SFML file directories:* <br />
• include directory - (Configurations -> C/C++ -> Additional Include Directories)<br />
• lib directory - (Configurations -> Linker -> Additional Library Directories)<br />

### Note:
• This project's original repo was originally worked on https://github.com/c-trinh/GameProject.Shogun-Master-Kanako.<br />
There are a variety of reasons why I cloned the original repo to this one:<br />
**1.)** The original repo was *forked* from an inactive member. In case something were to happen to the origin of the forked repo, I want to have this repo as a backup.<br />
**2.)** Despite this project initially being collaborative, the entire project (excluding background graphics) was done by me. This project was my first game programmed and got me interested in video-game programming. Hence, I would like to take ownership for my own work in case I plan on revisitting this project to expand upon later.
